###### Binary Tree ##############
A binary tree is made of nodes, where each node contains a "left" reference, a "right" reference, 
and a data element. The topmost node in the tree is called the root. 

A complete Binary tree is a binary tree which has left and right children, with exception at bottom level.
A full binary tree.is a binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children. 

-----Advantages of trees
Trees reflect structural relationships in the data
Trees are used to represent hierarchies
Trees provide an efficient insertion and searching 

*****Traversal****
A traversal is a process that visits all the nodes in the tree.
Traversal Algorithms are two kinds
DFS
BFS

There are three different types of depth-first traversals, :
    PreOrder traversal - visit the parent first and then left and right children;
    InOrder traversal - visit the left child, then the parent and the right child;
    PostOrder traversal - visit left child, then the right child and then the parent; 
    
BFS is top to bottom and from left to right
